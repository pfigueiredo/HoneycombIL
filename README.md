Honeycomb DSL (IL) - Excel compatible, IL compiled DSL for TimeSheet and Payroll Calculations

## About this version

This was the first version of the honeycomb language and was implemented in C# with MSIL compilation. For and up to date version written in Javascript working in the browser and/or in node.js see:

https://github.com/pfigueiredo/honeycombjs

As time permits I will be updating this version to be complete and compatible with the javascript implementation.
